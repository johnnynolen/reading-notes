# **Version Control**
- I like the idea that you can have a thread of your work to access back-and-forth.
- Version control offers a lot of flexibility with the modification and distribution of the files
- Version control seems like a very important piece of the tech industries colloborative toolkit.

## _**GIT**_
- Git, is native to your pc and keeps data and files readily avaliable for sharing and manipulating. 
- Git is intuitive with simple to understand language that doesn't present a headache and endless translation. 
- Git also has, "_auto-save_" like features that can further aid you in keeping your files from being lost and deleted unintentionally.

### **Workflow**
- involves working directory: where you actual files reside.
- includes index: the area used for staging.
- includes head: which points to the most recent commit.
