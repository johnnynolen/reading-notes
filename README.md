# Growth Mindset

I think growth mindset is taking on challenges without having a predicitive outcome and without knowing how the course will go. In life it is very unpredictable and we don't always know where we're going with the course or what the outcomes of our current actions will be. Continuing to push forward in any task or challenege we have and remembering that you can figure things out and you can learn to work on things you thought was rocket science.
