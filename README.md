# Growth Mindset

I think growth mindset is taking on challenges without having a predicitive outcome and without knowing how the course will go. In life it is very unpredictable and we don't always know where we're going with the course or what the outcomes of our current actions will be. Continuing to push forward in any task or challenege we have and remembering that you can figure things out and you can learn to work on things you thought was rocket science. Taking a structured and disciplined approach with hard effort will get you a long way.

## Reminders

1. Be *your*, own hero; 30, 60, 90 days, months, year, etc. Working throuhg obstacles as they come and conintuing to push forward will have a more benefical outcome 30 days of consistently builds momentum to turn it into 60 days, 120 days, and so on. 
2.  Learning anything new can be hard at first, understanding the basics and building ontop of those fundamentals can start increase your learning and understanding.
- **Crawl**, **Walk**, **Run**

3. Dont be afgraid of criticism and other progression compared to your own. Learning isn't a race. Use those negative thoughts and embrace the fact that if other people are learning it then you can as well.
  - What one man can do, another can do.
