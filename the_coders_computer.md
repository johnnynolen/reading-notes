Chapter 10

-	CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one heading should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface. 
Block level elements -
look like they start on a new line. Examples include the <h1>- <h6>, <p> and <div> elements. 

Inline elements  
flow within the text and do not start on a new line. Examples include <b>, <i>, <img>, <em> and <span>. 

-	Using CSS, you could add a border around any of the boxes, specify its width and height, or add a background color. You could also control text insidea box â€” for example, its color, size, and the typeface used.

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. 

*_Selector_* 
p{
font-family: Arial;
} 
 
 -	This rule indicates that all <p> elements should be shown in the Arial typeface. 
-	Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas. 
-	Declarations indicate how
the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value) and are separated by a colon. 
-	cSS propertIeS affect how eLeMentS are dISpLayed 
-	CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon. 
-	h1, h2, h3 { 
-	This rule indicates that all <h1>, <h2> and <h3> elements should be shown in the Arial typeface, in a yellow color. 
-	
-	font-family: Arial;
-	color: yellow;}
-	Properties indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, width, height and border. 
-	 
-	Values specify the settings
you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you want to specify a color property then the value is the color you want the text in these elements to be.

-	Here you can see a simple web page that is styled using CSS. 
-	This example uses two documents: the HTML file (example.html) and a separate CSS file (example.css). The fifth line of HTML uses the <link> element to indicate where the CSS file is located. 
-	On the next page, you will see how CSS rules can also be placed in your HTML pages and we will discuss when you might want to do this.
